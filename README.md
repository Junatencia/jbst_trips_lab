# ðŸ“˜ Application Overview and Enhancements

## ðŸ”¹ Application Description  

This FastAPI web application enables users to **upload and ingest CSV files** (e.g., trip data) with real-time monitoring of the ingestion process.  

- **CSV Upload**: Users upload CSV files via the `/ingest` endpoint.  
- **Background Processing**: Uploaded can be stored in local disk toor **S3/MinIO**., and a background ingestion job is queued using **Celery**.  
- **Ingestion Tracking**:  
  - Job progress and status are persisted in the `ingestion_status` table.  
  - Clients can monitor ingestion via:  
    - **WebSocket endpoint** (`/ws/{job_id}`) for real-time updates.  
    - **HTTP endpoint** (`/status/{job_id}`) for on-demand status checks.  
- **Core Infrastructure**:  
  - **Redis** for Celery and pub/sub messaging.  
  - **SQLAlchemy** for database access.  
  - **PgBouncer** for efficient connection pooling.  
  - Environment variables for configuration.  

In summary, the application allows CSV ingestion with **background processing, real-time updates, and scalable infrastructure**.

## ðŸ”¹ Applied Changes (Enhancements Implemented)

1. **Optimized Data Ingestion**  
   - Refactored ingestion to leverage **PostgreSQL COPY** for fast bulk loading.  
   - Introduced a **configurable chunk size** for flexible data handling.  

2. **Worker Scalability**  
   - Configured support for **multiple Celery workers**.  
   - Documented **autoscaling best practices** for Kubernetes deployments.  

3. **Database Improvements**  
   - Migrated to **TimescaleDB hypertables** for time-series optimization.  
   - Added **GIST** and **BRIN indexes** for improved query performance.  

4. **Connection Management**  
   - Integrated **PgBouncer** for efficient and scalable DB connection pooling.  
   - Updated the applicationâ€™s DB connection string accordingly.  

5. **Object Storage Integration**  
   - Shifted file storage from local disk to **S3/MinIO**.  
   - Updated ingestion jobs to fetch CSV files directly from object storage.

## âœ… Consolidated Summary  

The application now provides a **robust, scalable, and efficient data ingestion platform**:  

- Users upload CSV files.  
- Files are stored in **S3/MinIO** and processed in the background with **Celery**.  
- Ingestion performance is optimized with **PostgreSQL COPY, chunking, and TimescaleDB hypertables**.  
- **PgBouncer** ensures efficient database connections.  
- **Real-time monitoring** is available via WebSockets and on-demand via REST endpoints.  
- The system is **scalable across workers and Kubernetes clusters**, making it production-ready for high-volume ingestion workloads.
